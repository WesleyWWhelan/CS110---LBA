    "This solution, while far from optimal, demonstrates much of what I have learned in this class. Though we just learned dynamic programming and this is the first time I have used object-oriented programming for a novel application, I managed to include many aspects in the algorithm that helped this scheduler work correctly and quickly while staying organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to point out why we can use memoization for this problem. We know that each subproblem will have the same structure - a list of schedules in order with optimal summed benefit. We also know that the optimal solution for a given subproblem will contribute to the optimal solution for the next level if the chores do not overlap. Because of this, our application is successful in determining the optimal schedule. We store optimal solutions for each level (subproblems) and then add if no overlap and we increase benefit. If not, we simply pick between our solutions to find the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraints added a bit of complexity to the problem, but after many hours of working I understood that creating a new class and method for finding the benefit of the chore would be a useful solution to the problem. This does mean that we have to add a chore as a different class if we want to add a constraint, but this could be improved with more work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some assumptions that we have that may need to be re-assesed for a true, realistic solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not doing something doesn't decrease benefit (or increase) of another chore. For example, sleeping only 4 hours doesn't decrease the benefit of the class I have even though I will be tired during it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our hours can't shrink or stretch depending on needs. In life, there is flexibility and not everything happens on the dot. This algorithm is a #model, using a simplified version of life to understand how things work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensions to solve these problems would include structural changes to the algorithm and multiple methods added. I would like to, given I have time in the future for this, improve this algorithm by adding in a new method or aspect to the getBenefit method that decreases benefit given that another chore has been (or hasn't been) completed. For this, I would need to add new attributes to the object and restructure some minor aspects of my program. I attempted - and failed - this already, and there isn't enough time to keep working on, but I do think it is a very interesting addition that I would like to implement. Additionally, adding in segments or duplicates our chores could be helpful to solving the flexibility problem using duplicates, I could allow for more optimal solutions that could work around constraints. For example, having separate study times that would allow me to practice guitar in between them and still go to class (given that studying could be a constraint for class).\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, I am proud of this assignment and the progress I made as a python programmer. It was difficult, but I do think that this has improved my understanding of dynamic programming and python in general, as well as set me up to do better on the next assignments and outside work.\n",
